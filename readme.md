## Info

* This lab asks you to perform various tasks, first using only the DOM, and then using only JQuery.
* Your project folder should consist of 2 folders, `DOM` and `JQuery`, each containing an `index.html`, `scripts.js` and any CSS files.
* You should complete the tasks first in the `DOM` folder using only the DOM, and then complete the same tasks again in the `JQuery` folder using only JQuery.

## Objectives

01. Make a `button` appear on the page when it's first loaded. 
    * The `button` *cannot* already be in your `HTML`. When the `button` is clicked, you should display an alert box with a message.
02. Make a `button` and `text box` (you can just put them in your `HTML`). 
    * When the`button` is clicked, display an alert with the message that is typed in the `text box`.
03. Create a `div` in `HTML`. 
    * **Without** using CSS `:hover`, make the `div` change to a different background color when your mouse hovers over it. 
     * The `div` should return to its original color when the mouse exits the div.
04. Put some text in a paragraph. 
    * Make it where when you click on the paragraph, the color of the text switches to red. 
    * Once you get that working, try to rewrite your code to make it switch to a random color each click (you don't have to show the code for just red once you get random working).
05. Add a `button` and an empty `div`. 
    * When the `button` is clicked, add a `span` that contains your name to the empty `div`.
06. Create a `button` and a `ul` in your `HTML`. 
    * In JavaScript, create an array containing the names of your friends (at *least* 10). 
    * If you don't have that many, include your imaginary ones). 
    * When the `button` is clicked, add each friend's name as an `li` to the `ul` on the page.
